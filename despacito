"Despacito" (American Spanish: [despa'sito]; English: "Slowly") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee.[1][2] On January 12, 2017, Universal Music Latin released "Despacito" and its music video, which shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and the local bar La Factoría. The song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres. A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song's chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. "Despacito" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again.

It is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others, making it both Fonsi's and Daddy Yankee's most successful single to date. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since "Macarena" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-reigning number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. In August 2017, the official music video for "Despacito" became the most-viewed YouTube video of all-time after receiving its three billionth view. It became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, and six billion views.

Upon its release, "Despacito" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. The remix version has received three Grammy Awards nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards. "Despacito" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all-time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.

Background

Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender (pictured) co-wrote "Despacito" with Luis Fonsi.
After two years without releasing new music, Luis Fonsi wanted to create "a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I feel very comfortable singing and that will make people just dance."[3][4] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi's house after he expressed his desire to record a "swinging song" for his new album.[5] Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender, a Latin Grammy Award-winner, went to Luis Fonsi's house in Miami, who said to her that he woke up mulling about "writing a song called 'Despacito'."[6][7] Fonsi sang the lines "Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico", Ender replied "Hasta que las olas griten 'Ay Bendito'" and then they began to build the song.[7] The Puerto Rico line was moved to the end of the song in order to not sound "so regional" and they started writing a story.[7]

Fonsi originally composed "Despacito" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an "urban injection" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee through WhatsApp, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[4][8] Prior to collaborating on "Despacito", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on "Una Oportunidad", released digitally in 2010.[9] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse while thinking about his father playing bongos at his house, citing that as "percussion attacks," and wrote the post-chorus or hook.[10][11][12] They recorded the song in Miami in 2016.[13] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thalía, and Ricky Martin, among various Latin acts.[14][15][16]

Originally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of "Despacito".[17] Andrés Torres said that the track "kept getting postponed" because "there was always some issue with [it]."[18] After showing the demo to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on "Despacito" and leave the other works aside.[17] He stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded "powerful, fresh and different."[17] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that "it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat."[4] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee's work was a plus to the song because "it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table."[4] Mauricio Rengifo expressed that the song "really took 100 percent shape the day Yankee recorded."[18] Ender stated that the track "went through several arrangements" until Fonsi got "exactly the arrangement he wanted."[7]

Fonsi stated that he made "Despacito" a danceable song because "Latinos are known for being happy people" and that he feels the need of happy music.[19] He added that the "urban feel" in the song's rhythm is the type that "Latinos breathe in and out" and that it is "a synonym of party."[19] According to him, "Despacito" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[19] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track "made a special connection" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was "a great idea."[5] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they "needed to be responsible with a good lyric" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was "to take care of how to say things with a good taste."[5] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of "Despacito" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album Fénix.[18][20][21]

Three months after the release of the original version, Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix after seeing how people reacted to the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[22][23] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[24] On April 11, 2017, Bieber's manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin, who was preparing to go on a short holiday to the Caribbean until April 17, to work on the song.[25] He flew from Los Angeles to Bogota and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals in Estudios Audiovisión after American songwriter Jason Boyd sent his lyrics and melody outlines.[25]

Justin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician and Latin Grammy Award-nominee Juan Felipe Samper.[26][27][28] After recording the beginning of the song, Bieber approached Samper in order to receive coaching with his Spanish pronunciation, which he wanted to be perfect.[28] He stated that what cost Justin Bieber the most was the 'ere' (ɾ) sound in words like "laberinto" (labyrinth), "paredes" (walls) and "manuscrito" (manuscript).[28] Samper wrote the lyrics of the song phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was "perfectly" achieved in two hours.[28]

Josh Gudwin used a Neumann U47 microphone, a Neve 1081 microphone preamplifier and a Tube-Tech CL1B compressor for the four-hour recording session, and sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris "Tek" O'Professional Sad Puppy Face for vocal tuning.[25] Gudwin completed re-arranging the song and started to mix it while waiting during a five-hour lay-over at Miami International Airport.[25] He concluded the production of the remix version in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[25] The entire process until the release date took six days.[25] Mauricio Rengifo stated that Justin Bieber "approached reggaeton in a very different way" and that "the melody he does at the beginning is not reggaeton at all but it fits beautifully."[29]

In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but Justin Bieber "advantaged him."[30][31] He also stated that he likes reggaeton music, saying that it has a "good rhythm" and that "everyone enjoys it."[31]

Composition
"Despacito" is a reggaeton[32][33] and Latin pop[34][35] song composed in common time (4
4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm—G—D—A.[36] The vocals span from F#4 to A5.[37] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[38][39] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[40][41]

Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres produced "Despacito" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[29] Rengifo said that "an interesting thing about this song is that it breaks a lot of rules" and that they "usually do not take one minute to get to the chorus, but when it works, it works."[29] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[29] Rengifo stated that the guitar "was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital."[29] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted "to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic" and that it "gives the song a really unique character."[29] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and "old school pop" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[29] Percussion instruments guache and güira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[29] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus "more prominent," silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[42] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word "despacito" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[42] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, güira, and sequenced drum patterns.[29]

The remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee's verses were kept from the original version.[26] It has a length of three minutes and forty-eight seconds. For the beginning of the song, Josh Gudwin adjusted the levels of some of the instrumental tracks and arranged and muted parts of the original vocals in order to have more space for Bieber.[25] The final mix consisted of 67 tracks.[25]

Release and reception
"Despacito" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin.[43] It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version.[44] Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of hit singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[45] Fonsi considered the trend to be "the new pop", and Ender said of it, "everyone is making this type of fusions."[3][5] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from "people who normally don't call. People who only call when something different is going on." He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him it was a "home run."[46]

The song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between "Latin sensual rhythms" and urban music, describing it as "masterful."[47] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that "a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start."[48] He added that "'Despacito' has the magic it takes to reach the world" and that "works both on the dancefloors and on the radio."[48] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an "infectious tune" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is "great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business."[49] Diana Marti of E! News said that "it is almost impossible not to dance to it."[50] Caroline Soriano of Enstars magazine described the song's beat as "quite sexy and catchy" and defined the lyrics as "captivating."[51] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone magazine described it as alluring, sexy and catchy.[13] Leila Cobo of Billboard expressed that "Despacito" is "a great pop song", highlighting the "undeniable immediate catchiness" of the pre-chorus and the chorus.[52] Cobo also stated that it "is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat, subtly naughty lyrics, a rapper's contemporary edge and an irresistible chorus that can be applied to so many situations."[53]

Robert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need stated in his review that the song has "something very interesting happening" and that it can be classified as a Latin-American song because of its composition and characteristics.[42] He highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, on which flamenco is usually played, representing "a modern take on a historical musical style."[42] Joffred also stated that what makes "Despacito" a "great song" is that it "throws decades of tradition to the wind in a very subtle way" because of the presence of "swung rhythms" when the word "Despacito" is sung at the beginning of the chorus.[42] He referred to the text painting as "pretty genius."[42] Petra Rivera-Rideau, author of Remixing Reggaetón: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico (2015), said that "what's great about 'Despacito' is that it shows reggaeton never really went away" and that the song's success "makes her really excited to see what's going to happen next."[54] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as "an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune."[55]

Spanish record producer Nahúm García stated that "the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius," referring to the first time Luis Fonsi performs the word "Despacito".[56] He explained that "the brain realizes that there has been a rare breakdown and it catches its eye",[56] and claimed that this "trick" in particular is not very common "and much less in pop music."[56] García concluded stating that the song "is very well made."[56] James Kellaris, composer and professor at the University of Cincinnati's business school,[57] expressed that "'Despacito' contains earworm elements" for being "cheerful, simple, repetitive and having a sticky rhythm."[56] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics after being translated to English, referring to them as "quite rude and a bit creepy" and stating that "some people might find them offensive."[58] Christian Koch of The Culture Trip also referred to the lyrics as "creepy."[59] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that "the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting."[60] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances, describing them as "one of a kind."[61] Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx described it as "the perfect mix of everything pop fans want: it's acoustic and sexy, but with a fun beat, and it gives the feeling that you are listening to something new."[62]

The remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017 by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and School Boy Records.[63][64] It is the first collaboration between Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee with Bieber. The remix's official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[65] Hilton Dresden of Out magazine described it as "unexpected and delightful" and that "Justin Bieber singing in Spanish is a highly sexual experience," defining the results of the collaboration as legendary.[66] Caroline Soriano of Ernstars magazine stated that Bieber's voice "sounds appealing with the song," whose remix version make it sound "a little bit better."[51] Latina's Daniela Galvez described Bieber singing in Spanish as "amazing."[67]

The song has also appeared on the top 10 of several year-end and best of all-time lists. Billboard's critics ranked the original version the fourth best song overall and the best Latin song of 2017, as well as the fifth best Latin song of all-time, referring to it as "one of the biggest hits in Latin music history" and "one of the biggest singles of all-time."[83][84][85] Rolling Stone selected it as the seventh best song of 2017, stating that it became "your suburban grandmother's favorite Spanish-language song since 'La Bamba'."[86] Rolling Stone Argentina ranked it the sixth best song of the year and described its formula as an "unappealable pop solidity that leaves no escape."[87] Time magazine ranked it the third best song of 2017, closing a brief review by stating that "in a year where xenophobia reared its head worldwide, it inspires hope that the charts were dominated by such a universal, multicultural hit."[55] It was also ranked the third and 14th best international song of the year by Rockdelux and Rolling Stone Brazil, respectively.[88][89]

The remix version alone was ranked the 29th and 38th best song of 2017 by Noise magazine and Spin, respectively; the latter stating that "it managed to transcend genre, time, space, and even personal taste in a way that was unprecedented."[90][91] It was also ranked the 20th and 21st best song of the year by PopSugar and The New York Times, respectively.[92][93] National Public Radio's critics selected it as the 51st best song of 2017, describing it as a "damn good song" and adding that "writing a hit that will be remembered by millions is hard enough, but one remembered by billions?"[61] The remix was also ranked the 44th and 46th best song of the year by The Village Voice and Uproxx, respectively.[94][62] The Guardian included it among the 100 best tracks of the year.[95] Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee were selected as the "Stars of the Year" by People en Español in November 2017.[96]

Rolling Stone's critics ranked the track 91st in its "100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Far" list in June 2018.[97] The magazine also included it in its "50 Greatest Latin Pop Songs" list in July 2018, describing it as "the undeniable all-time champion of Latin pop" and "one of the most successful hits in pop music history."[98] Billboard selected it among the best Latin summer songs of all-time in August 2018, referring to the track as a "classic."[99]

"Despacito" was inducted to the 2019 edition of the Guinness World Records for achieving seven milestones: most weeks at number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart, most-viewed and most-liked video online, most-viewed music video online, most-viewed music video on YouTube for a duet, first YouTube video to receive five billion views, and most-streamed song worldwide.[100][101]

Controversies
In July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that "Despacito" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[102] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were "not suitable to be heard."[102]

Commercial performance
United States
In the United States, the single debuted at number two on Billboard's multi-metric Hot Latin Songs chart on February 4, 2017, becoming Fonsi's highest-charting single since June 13, 2009, when "Aquí Estoy Yo" peaked at the top position.[103][104] "Despacito" also became Fonsi's and Daddy Yankee's first number one hit single on the US Latin Digital Songs chart after selling 11,000 downloads on the week ending on February 4, 2017.[103][105] It was Daddy Yankee's highest debut ever on the Hot Latin Songs chart, in which he marked his 48th career hit.[103] "Despacito" reached number one on the US Hot Latin Songs chart on February 18, 2017 and remained there for 35 consecutive weeks until October 14, 2017.[106][63] In 2018, it returned to number one in three different runs for 17 consecutive weeks from January 6 to April 28 and for other four non-consecutive weeks between August 4 and September 1, totaling 56 non-consecutive weeks.[63][107][108][109] It is the longest-reigning number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart, surpassing the 41 weeks of "Bailando" by Enrique Iglesias featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, achieved between May 2014 to February 2015, on the issue dated February 17, 2018.[110][111][112] "Despacito" left the Hot Latin Songs chart on March 9, 2019 after 110 consecutive weeks, becoming the list's second longest-charting title, due to a recurrent rule that removes songs that rank below number five after 52 weeks.[113][114][115][116] The track has never ranked below the top five of Hot Latin Songs during the entirety of its run.[63][117][118] After falling to recurrent status, "Despacito" has topped the Hot Latin Songs Recurrents chart since the week ending on March 9, 2019.[119] It has also topped the US Latin Digital Songs and Latin Streaming Songs charts for 69 and 59 non-consecutive weeks, respectively, and is the second longest-running number-one on both lists.[120][121][122]

Impact
Latin music
The success of the song and its remix version led Daddy Yankee to become the most listened-to artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify on July 9, 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so.[201][202][203] He later became the fifth most listened-to male artist and the sixth overall of 2017 on Spotify.[204] In June 2017, "Despacito" was cited by Billboard's Leila Cobo as the song that renewed interest in the Latin music market from recording labels in the United States.[205] Julyssa Lopez of The Washington Post stated that the successes of "Despacito" and J Balvin's "Mi Gente" is "the beginning of a new Latin crossover era."[206] Stephanie Ho of Genius website wrote that "the successes of 'Despacito' and 'Mi Gente' could point to the beginning of a successful wave for Spanish-language music in the US."[207] Ho also stated that "as 'Despacito' proves, fans don't need to understand the language in order to enjoy the music", referring to the worldwide success of the song, including various non-Spanish-speaking countries.[207]

In October 2017, Xander Zellner of Billboard credited the influence of the single's commercial success for the Latin music domination in the US mainstream market during 2017, as eleven primarily-Spanish-language songs have debuted on the Hot 100 as of October 21, compared to two in 2016 and five in 2015.[132] American songwriter Desmond Child and Cuban musician Rudy Pérez, founders of the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame, expressed that "not since Ricky Martin's 'Livin' La Vida Loca' has there been a song in any genre that has had the global impact of 'Despacito', changing the course of pop music forever and ushering in an explosive new era of unlimited opportunities for all Latin music creators."[70] In December 2017, Lars Brandle of Billboard related the success of "Despacito" with the increase of Latin music's global popularity, as six out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos in 2017 were for songs performed in Spanish by Latin artists. Brandle referred to it as "the 'Despacito' effect".[208] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard stated that the success of the song represented that "English is no longer a requirement for mainstream U.S. success."[209]

In December 2017, British Official Charts Company recognized "Despacito" as the song that "helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again" and highlighted that "Little Mix, Matt Terry, Demi Lovato and Camila Cabello all released Latin inspired songs this year."[210] Writing for Nielsen's 2017 Music Year-End Report, Erin Crawford stated that "Despacito" had "a halo effect on several other Latin hits ripe for crossover success, most notably J Balvin & Willy William's 'Mi Gente,' which catapulted to the top of the Hot Latin Songs chart after Beyoncé made a 'Despacito'-esque cameo on the song in September to help raise proceeds for families affected by Hurricane Maria."[137] In June 2018, Rolling Stone magazine stated that the song "hastened a massive historical turn in American music, demonstrating the mainstream viability of Spanish-language pop."[97] In July 2018, John Ochoa of Rolling Stone stated that "the resulting so-called 'Despacito effect' has advanced a wave of subsequent Spanish-language hits and mainstream crossovers, from the Latin trap explosion to J Balvin's reggaeton globalization."[98] In August 2018, Billboard affirmed that the song's influence has impacted other Latin crossovers, including "Mi Gente".[211]

The Recording Industry Association of America reported in April 2018 that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, "driven primarily by music streaming," whose revenue increased 84% compared to 2016.[212] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017, "driven largely by a 48.9% increase in streaming revenues that helped offset a 41.5% decline in physical revenue."[193] "Despacito" has been described by the IFPI as "a game-changing hit from Latin America to the world" and declared it "the song of 2017."[193] IFPI's chief executive Frances Moore described the song as a "global smash hit" and related its success with "the broadening appeal of Latin music."[193] In July 2018, Billboard reported that Latin music's consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018, directly relating it with the success of "Despacito" during 2017.[213]

Economic impact
In July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[214][215] Tour operators cite the song's music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factoría and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[216]

Music video
Background

2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera co-starred in the music video.

Video views on YouTube grew virally, and peaked about 28 weeks after video was posted.[217]

Cumulative views of the video exhibit a slower, though stable, growth rate after its first year.[217]
The music video for "Despacito" was directed by Puerto Rican director Carlos Pérez and produced by Joanna Egozcue and Roxy Quiñones.[218] Filming took place in December 2016 in La Perla neighborhood and the popular bar La Factoría in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[218] Carlos Pérez had previously worked with Luis Fonsi on "Corazón en la Maleta" (2014) and also with Daddy Yankee on clips including "Gasolina" (2004), "Rompe" (2005), "Gangsta Zone" (2006), "Descontrol" (2010), and "Ven Conmigo" (2011), among others.[219] Puerto Rican cinematographer Thomas Marvel and Puerto Rican stylist Yasiri Castro have also worked on the music video.[220]

Wanting Carlos Pérez to direct the clip, Luis Fonsi reached him the song and wanted to make "something special." According to Fonsi, Pérez was impressed with the track after listening to it, and showed interest in the project.[46] Fonsi then called 2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera, wanting her to represent "the Latina powerful woman." She called him back 10 minutes later and replied that it was "the best song she had ever heard."[46]

Fonsi stated that the music video celebrates Latin American culture, saying that movement, dancing and rhythm are "engraved into his bones." He also affirms that part of the song's success was the reception of the fans, capturing the best of Fonsi's romantic ballad and danceable facets.[19] Carlos Perez stated that the clip "directly supports the vibe of the song" and that it "is a video that has soul to it."[221] Jorge Muñíz Ortíz of EFE stated that the music video "highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico" by showing its "splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, even Zuleyka Rivera's hips movement, and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes."[8]

On April 10, 2018, Luis Fonsi's YouTube Vevo account was hacked by an anonymous group, who removed the music video for "Despacito" from his channel for hours before becoming available again.[222] BBC News reported that clips from more than a dozen Vevo channels, including those of Drake, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Shakira, were also affected.[223] The hackers stated that "the act was not malicious, but just in good fun."[223]

Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee perform the song in a street while elders are playing dominos, a child is getting his hair cut, two people are talking while listening to the radio, and couples are dancing in the background. The video intercalates with shots of Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing in front of a car with people sitting on it and dancing next to it. As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factoría bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[8] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[8]
